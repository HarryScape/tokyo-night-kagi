# 🏙 Kagi Theme: Tokyo Night

A custom CSS for [Kagi Search Engine](https://kagi.com/) ported from the Visual Studio Code
[TokyoNight](https://github.com/enkia/tokyo-night-vscode-theme) theme.

Some page elements have been hidden for minimalism.

## 🚀 Usage

Just copy the contents of kagi.css and paste into the custom CSS box in Kagi's appearence settings.

## 🔥 Contributing

Feel free to pull request, tweak and improve it. Not all of my CSS colours are accurate to the official Tokyo Night colour palette, such as the border on the Web|Images|Videos|News|Maps tabs. They're close enough by default, so it's not very noticable, but I will fix this at a later date. Also the code is poorly organised as I just added and changed things as I went along (apologies).
